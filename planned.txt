Initial features
1. Serialising name, colour, equipment grid
2. Ensuring persistency across saves
3. Test delivering spidertrons to other zones
4. Test opening in nav sat
5. Check for if no spidertrons launched then error message:
6. Compatibility to launch other Spiders
7. Luanch other bots - construction / logistic / combat

Later features:
Gui / orbital management
    - Gui displaying more information on the spidertron
        - hover over to show the equipment grid
    - Assign the spidertron to a group 
        - Use a symbol to represent which group the spidertron is a part of
    - Have a combinator read outputs
        - Use circuit controls to for activate inserters
            eg. if Symbol for builder spidertron is below 1 then launch
    - Require rocket fuel
        Keep the orbital station stocked with fuel for the orbital launches
    - Deploy with other items (limited)
        Ammo - construction bots (anything else?)
        Is a landing pad too much (you can fire over delivery cannon resources until you can build a chest)

Realism
    Time delay from launch / calculated by distance
    Potential limitation to deploy within the solar system only
