Version: 2.9.83
Date: 2026-01-06
  Locale:
    - Hardcoded values have been added to the locale file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.9.82
Date: 2025-12-27
  Bugfixes:
    - Change in mod-data storage resulted in the deployment menu equipment button to not work properly. Fixed with the correct mod-data
  Changes:
    - Updates the supplies deployment tab to Robots, and corrected the robot deployment information
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.9.8
Date: 2025-12-27
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed deployment menu not opening when clicking vehicle deploy buttons
    - Fixed platform deployment button not appearing when opening platform hub

Version: 2.9.7
Date: 2025-12-27
  Features:
    - Remote Container Deployment
      - Remotely deploy Logistic / Construction robots from a container. Rather than needing to manually, or struggle remotely to add robots to a network.
      - Remotely deploy Spider-vehicles from a container. Spider-vehicles only as they have somewhat of their own intelligence and should be able to deploy themselves. Not car vehicle types due to the potential collision complications.
    - Remote Supplies Deployment tab
      - Deploy robots directly to the surface below. Similar to how the mod deploys vehicles. 
      - Robots do not auto deploy, you will have to deploy them from the container.
  Notes:
    - Logistic and Construction robots auto-join a roboport network if available. Remain stationary until they in a network construction area.
    - Construction bots prefer to join a vehicle network if available. Logistic bots only join Roboport networks.

    - Fixed equipment ghost detection using equipment.prototype.type instead of name pattern matching
    - Fixed planet display name to use space_location.localised_name for proper localization
